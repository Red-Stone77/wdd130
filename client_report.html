        <h2>Final Report</h2>
        <hr><br><br>
        <h3>Client Role Report</h3>
        <p>I decided on the content and images for my site plan to better showcase the allure of Hatusne Miku and Kasane Teto's music.</p>
        <p>I communicated with my developer through discord. There was a few small issues with communication at the start that got ironed out fairly quickly.</p>
        <p>My developer did not meet my expectations for my site.</p>
        <p>Next time I will create a better site plan that is easier for the team I hire to build my website.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Lead Dev Report</h3>
        <p>I managed my developement team through text, and distributing work for my junior developers to do.</p>
        <p>I comunicated with my client through email and in-person.</p>
        <p>I published the clients website through GitHub, and shared it with him through email.</p>
        <p>I did not have any issues managing the site with GitHub></p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Jr Dev Report</h3>
        <p>I communicated with one of my team leads through email. The other I did not get any contact from.</p>
        <p>I was not given any expectations for the sites I was supposed to work on.</p>
        <p>I was unable to contribute to my sites as I was not given any directions from the lead developers.</p>
        <p>I did not run into any issues with GitHub since I did not have any instructions to work on them.</p>

        <h3>General Experience and Reflections</h3>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was getting the team together. I was able to for the project I ran, but not for the others.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed coming up with a design for my website to be made.</p>
        <p>If I could do the project again, I would definitely come up with a more straight and well thought site plan.</p>
        <p>I feel a little more confident in working on real-world projects after taking this class.</p>
